With unsupervised learning, we're given data x that isn't associated with any output labels `y`. The job is to **find something interesting in unlabelled data**, for example clustering data or finding patterns. The algorithm figures this out without using supervision.


Formal definition: Data only comes with inputs x, but not output labels y. Algorithms have to find **structure** in the data
### Clustering

Grouping data points based on their similarity with each other, aimed at gaining insights from those unlabelled data points.

### Anomaly Detection
Used to detect unusual data points
Example: fraud detection in a financial transaction systems

### Dimensionality Reduction
Compress data using fewer numbers
