## Introduction to Machine Learning
Machine Learning - a subfield of artificial intelligence - is a science to get computers to learn without having to be explicitly programmed. 
Artificial General Intelligence which is building machines as intelligent as humans. AI researchers believe that the best way to achieve this is by using learning algorithms.


## What is Machine Learning?

> Machine Learning - Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed - Arthur Samuel (1959)

The two main types of machine learning algorithms are:
* [[Supervised Learning]] - Learn from data **labeled** with the "right answers"
	* Used most in real-world applications
	* most rapid advancements
	* Our focus in Course 1 and 2
* [[Unsupervised Learning]] - Find something interesting in **unlabelled** data
	* Our focus in Course 3
* Recommender systems
* Reinforcement learning
