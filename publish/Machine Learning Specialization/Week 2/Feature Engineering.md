Creating a new feature is called feature engineering
* Using intuition to design new features, by transforming or combining original features to make it easier for the model to make accurate predictions


### Polynomial Regression
This allows you to fit curves to your data. Let's say we want to fit something like: 
$$f_{\vec{w},b}(x) =w_1x+w_2x^2+b$$
But it might only be true for half of the equation, i.e until it reaches the maximum.

Feature scaling becomes increasingly important.
